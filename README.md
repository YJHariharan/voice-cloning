# üß† Voice Cloning using Deep Learning

## üìå Overview
The **Voice Cloning Project** is a deep learning‚Äìbased system that can replicate a human voice using a small sample of speech.  
By combining **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** synthesis, **Speaker Embeddings**, and **Neural Vocoders**, this project generates natural and expressive cloned speech that closely matches the target speaker‚Äôs tone, pitch, and style.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement
The challenge is to build a model capable of cloning a speaker‚Äôs voice using limited voice samples.  
The cloned voice should maintain **clarity, emotional tone**, and **linguistic accuracy** across various text inputs.

---

## üîç Scope
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating a **neural speech synthesis pipeline** that integrates:
- Speaker encoding networks to capture vocal identity  
- Text-to-speech models for linguistic content  
- Neural vocoders (like **WaveGlow** or **HiFi-GAN**) for realistic audio generation  

**Applications include:**
- Personalized virtual assistants  
- Audiobook and film dubbing  
- Accessibility tools for speech-impaired users  
- Interactive gaming and entertainment
