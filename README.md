# 🧠 Voice Cloning using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
The **Voice Cloning Project** is a deep learning–based system that can replicate a human voice using a small sample of speech.  
By combining **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** synthesis, **Speaker Embeddings**, and **Neural Vocoders**, this project generates natural and expressive cloned speech that closely matches the target speaker’s tone, pitch, and style.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The challenge is to build a model capable of cloning a speaker’s voice using limited voice samples.  
The cloned voice should maintain **clarity, emotional tone**, and **linguistic accuracy** across various text inputs.

---

## 🔍 Scope
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating a **neural speech synthesis pipeline** that integrates:
- Speaker encoding networks to capture vocal identity  
- Text-to-speech models for linguistic content  
- Neural vocoders (like **WaveGlow** or **HiFi-GAN**) for realistic audio generation  

**Applications include:**
- Personalized virtual assistants  
- Audiobook and film dubbing  
- Accessibility tools for speech-impaired users  
- Interactive gaming and entertainment

## 🚀 How to Run
### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-cloning.git
cd voice-cloning

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download model files

Place the downloaded models in the /models directory.

4. Run the voice cloning pipeline
python src/clone_voice.py --input_text "Hello, welcome to the voice cloning demo!" --speaker sample.wav

🖼️ Output

The generated speech will be saved under /output.

Example:

output/
└── cloned_voice.wav


🎧 The cloned voice reproduces tone, pitch, and rhythm similar to the original speaker.

📊 Inference & Conclusion

This project demonstrates how deep learning models can effectively reproduce human-like voices using limited data.
By integrating speaker embeddings with neural vocoders, the system achieves realistic, clear, and expressive voice synthesis.

Future Enhancements:

Multi-language voice cloning

Emotion and tone control

Real-time voice modulation for live applications
